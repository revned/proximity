# proximity

Proximity monitors the proximity of your mobile phone or other bluetooth device and executes custom AppleScripts when the device goes out of range or comes into range of your computer.

## Purpose
The intent of this project is for the source code to be critiqued by other developers in hopes of improving my Cocoa programming abilities, as well as my programming skills in general.

## Feedback
Feedback and feature requests are welcome. Please consider making a [donation](http://reduxcomputing.com/donate.php) to support future development.
